# Spanish Respellings

A small script to transcribe Spanish text into multiple alternativ orthografies.

The available orthografies are the ones sugested by:

- [Gonzalo Korreas (ES)](https://www.wikiwand.com/es/Gonzalo_Correas) in the early 17th century (not complete)
- [Andrés Bello](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bello_orthography) in the early 19th century
- [Fernando Vaḷejo (ES)](https://elpais.com/cultura/2013/10/22/actualidad/1382409408_424831.html)


## Why?

It's a simple exercise to test the regex facilities of a programming language.

I also think spelling reforms are neat.
