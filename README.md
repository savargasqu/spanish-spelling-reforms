# Spanish spelling reform transcriber

A small script to transcribe Spanish text into multiple alternativ orthografies.

The available orthografies are the ones suggested by:

- [Gonzalo Korreas (ES)](https://www.wikiwand.com/es/Gonzalo_Correas), in the early 17th century
- [Andrés Bello](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bello_orthography) in the early 19th century
- [Fernando Vaḷejo (ES)](https://elpais.com/cultura/2013/10/22/actualidad/1382409408_424831.html), in the early 21th century

## Why?

I thought it was a neat exercise to learn Julia, and to practice text procesing.

I also think spelling reforms are a great idea (both in English and Spanish).
Spanish specifically had very fonetically-focused spelling reforms,
some of which were recalled during the early days of the Royal Spanish Academy.
Stil, the fact that transcription can be don automatically using regular expresions,
shows that Spanish is regular enuf.
