# Spanish spelling reforms

A script to transliterate Spanish text into multiple alternative orthographies.
Work in progress.

TODO:
  - Multiple reforms: Korreas, Bello, etc
  - Add args. If no output file is given, print to stdout
  - Error handling (File not found)
  - Iterate over file line by line? (for very large files)
  - Revise old essay, and make a notebook
